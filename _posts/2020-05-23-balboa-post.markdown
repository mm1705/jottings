- Fight is about 90% brain and 10% muscle. 

- Somewhere along the line, you  changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're not good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow. Let me tell you something you already know:
`This world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it'll beat u to your knees and keep u there permanently if u let it. You, me or nobody hits as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.` Now, if you know what you're worth then go and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where u wanna be  because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that, and that ain't you. You're better than that.
