[Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(franchise)) is one of the best action comedy films ever made. One of the strange thing about these movies is: they are a lot more funnier in Hindi than in English.
<br />

Anyways, there is a song which becomes sort of a signature of Lee and Carter, protagonists of this franchise. This song is [`War`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(The_Temptations_song)).  
<br />
The message from this song: `"War,what is it good for? Absolutely nothin'!"`.
